Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class should have the following properties:

Description—The Description property should hold a brief description of the item.

UnitsOnHand—The UnitsOnHand property should hold the number of units currently in inventory.

Price—The Price property should hold the item’s retail price.

Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each property.

The application should create an array of three RetailItem objects containing the following data:

        Description	Units on Hand	Price
Item 1	Jacket	      12	59.95
Item 2	Jeans	        40	34.95
Item 3	Shirt	        20	24.95
The application should have a loop that steps through the array, displaying each element’s properties.

Your application should include a ListBox control which will be responsible for displaying the items data. Display one item info per line. You may also add a heading line just like the table in your book. Your application should also use a label to display the total number of items in your array.
