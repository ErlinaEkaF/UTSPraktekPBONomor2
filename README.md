Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class should have the following member variables:
description-a string that holds a brief description of the item.
unitsOnHand-an int that holds the number of units currently in inventory
price- a double that holds the items retail price

write a constructor that accepts arguments for each member variable, appropriate mutator functions that store values in these member variables, and accessor functions that return the values in these member variables. Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates 3 RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them.
                Description           Units On Hand                    Price
Item#1      Jacket                    12                               59.95
Item#2      Designer Jeans            40                               34.95
Item#3      Shirt                     20                               24.95                

The application should have a loop that steps through the array, displaying each elementâ€™s properties.

Your application should include a ListBox control which will be responsible for displaying the items data. Display one item info per line. You may also add a heading line just like the table in your book. Your application should also use a label to display the total number of items in your array.
